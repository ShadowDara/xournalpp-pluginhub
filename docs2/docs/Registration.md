# Registrate

How to registrate a plugin?

1. Your pluigin must have the files mentioned above

2. open the `registration` folder

3. create a new json file the name of your pluigin and paste this:

```json
{
    "main_link": "example_file"
}
```

4. add the link


## Plugin Structure

Your plugin musst have a 
```
index.json
```
file in the root directory *(as well as the standard `plugin.ini` and lua files)*

**The Content of this file looks like this:**

```json
{
    "name": "noname_plugin",
    "namespace": "noname",
    "author": "Shadowdara",
    "description": "example file",
    "license": "MIT",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "link": "",
    "available_for": [
        "1.2.7"
    ],
    "other_versions": [
        {
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "available_for": [
                "1.2.6"
            ],
            "link": "source code link"
        }
    ]
}
```

**namespace** MUSST be same as your json file in `registration`,
else it does not work!

You can of course add multiple **other versions** and multiple versions
to **available_for**

**Need an example?** Click [here](../example)

Save this files then in a new Repository, must be in the ROOT of the repository!

No subdirs!

For another Versions, use other branches of the Repo or another repo, but the root of
the repo and add them in the link
